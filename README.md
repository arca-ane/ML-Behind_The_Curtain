# ML-Behind_The_Curtain
Project Under Stamatics, IIT Kanpur

The Project Introduced me to Machine Learning

Assignment 1 covered the basic mathematics and python libraries like numpy.

Assignment 2 Covered Activation function , gradient decent, loss function , use of matplotlib and training basic Binary Classification Model.

In Assignment 3, We build Our first Neural Network
Learned How to
- Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
- Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh 
- Compute the cross entropy loss 
- Implement forward and backward propagation
